   - Enter how many shares you own
   - Click "Add"

2. **Set Your Targets**: 
   - Double-click the "Target %" column for each stock
   - Enter what percentage of your portfolio it should be (like 25 for 25%)

3. **Get Recommendations**: 
   - Click "Refresh Prices" to get current stock prices
   - Look at the "Rebalance Action" column to see what to buy or sell

## Troubleshooting

### Python Version Issues
**"No module named '_tkinter'" error:**
- **Mac**: `brew install python-tk`
- **Ubuntu/Linux**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`  
- **Windows**: Should work automatically with standard Python

**App won't start:**
- Make sure you're using Python 3.8 or newer: `python --version`
- Try using `python3` instead of `python`

### Standalone App Issues
**macOS: "App can't be opened" security warning:**
- Right-click the app → "Open" → Click "Open" in the dialog
- Or run: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine StockAllocationTool.app`

**Windows: Antivirus blocking the executable:**
- This is common with PyInstaller apps - add an exception for the executable
- The app is safe - it's just not code-signed

**Slow startup on first run:**
- The standalone app extracts dependencies on first run
- Subsequent runs will be faster

### Network Issues
**Can't connect to get stock prices:**
- Check your internet connection
- Some corporate networks block financial data - try from home

## Future Features

The following features are being considered for future releases:

- **📁 Multiple Portfolio Files**: Open and manage different portfolio JSON files
- **💾 File System Integration**: Native file dialogs for opening/saving portfolios
- **📊 Portfolio Comparison**: Compare performance across different portfolio files
- **🔄 Portfolio Templates**: Save and reuse allocation strategies
- **📈 Historical Tracking**: Track portfolio performance over time
